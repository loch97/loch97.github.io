      <description>Investigated the feasibility of relay-based wireless avionics intra-communication (WAIC) using IEEE 802.11 standard. Developed a SolidWorks model of the avionics compartment to simulate multipath channel (ray-tracing algorithm) and fading effects. Analyzed the delay-violation probability performance of the transmitter under different fading conditions (flat and frequency-selective) using the effective capacity model (Stochastic Network Calculus), and explored the impact of variable-bit-rate traffic on the performance. Proposed a power allocation scheme to maximize the effective capacity of a single relay system (When the QoS exponent approaches infinity, the effective capacity degenerates to zero-outage capacity).</description>

      <description>Developed a comprehensive dataset of bird images from video frames, including various species, poses, and backgrounds, to serve as a foundation for training and testing the YOLOv4 model. Employed and optimized YOLOv4 for bird detection in aerial images using Python and Tensorflow, with a focus on improving model accuracy and robustness. Evaluated the performance of YOLOv4, comparing results with YOLOv3 and showed improved detection performance of YOLOv4 in the presence of occlusion and overlapping cases.</description>

      <description> Utilized traditional image processing techniques to extract blood vessels from fundus images and localize the macular region using a template-matching algorithm. Developed and trained a Gradient Boosting Machine classifier to classify lesion images, demonstrating good robustness across different datasets. </description>
